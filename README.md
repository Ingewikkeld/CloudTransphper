CloudTransphper is a demo website built by [Ingewikkeld](http://php.ingewikkeld.net/) to show off the features of the [CloudVPS](http://www.cloudvps.com/) object store service.

It has been built on top of [Symfony2](http://www.symfony.com/), and used [PuPHPet](http://www.puphpet.com/) to generate the base Puppet configuration.
